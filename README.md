### Description
Minitalk is project about how to make process send message to each other by use UNIX signal
### **Concept**
- Signal in C
- BITWISE Operation
- Unicode
- UTF-8

### Project instructions
- Name your executable files **client** and **server**.
- You must submit a Makefile that compiles your source files. It must not perform unnecessary relinking.
- Program must handle errors thoroughly. And not quite unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, and so forth)
- program must be free of **memory leaks**.

### Allowed function
- write()
- ft_printf()
- signal()
- sigemptyset()
- sigaddset()
- sigaction()
- kill()
- getpid()
- malloc()
- free()
- pause()
- sleep()
- usleep()
- exit()

### Mandatory Part
- The server must be started first and print its PID.
- The client take two parameter: `The server PID` and `The string to send`.
- The client must send specified string to server. Once received, the server must print it.
- The server must print string without delay.
- Server should be able to receive strings from several clients without needing to restart.
- Communication must exclusively use UNIX signals only.
- Can only use these two signals: `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`.
[[42Project/minitalk/Note]]

### How to send text
I will use `SIGUSR1` to represent `1` and `SIGUSR2` to represent `0`. Now, there's a plenty of encoding format to use such as ACSII, Unicode and UTF-8. This encoding format will change out text into binary code that contain `0` and `1`. We can use this advantage to adapt this into our project.

**💡Solution key**: Find the way to convert text into binary
### Solution
I use bitwise operation to convert each charater into binary then send it with signal `SIGUSR1` or `SIGUSR2`

### Bonus Part
- The server must acknowledge each received message by sending a signal to the client.
- Unicode characters support

### Instruction

#### Compilation
```bash
make         # build the minitalk binary
make clean   # remove object files
make fclean  # remove object files and binary
make re      # full rebuild
make bonus   # build the minitalk binary bonus part
```

#### Execution
1. Start server, then server will show PID
```bash
./server
```
```bash
PID: xxxxx
```
2. Run client with format `./client <pid> <text>`
```bash
./client xxxxx "Hello"
```
##### Server output
```bash
./server
PID: xxxxx
Hello
```

#### Bonus part command
```bash
./server // Run server binary file
./client <pid> <text> // Run client bianary file
```

#### Example
##### Mandatory
**Server**
```bash
./server
PID: 89034
Hello Minitalk 
```
**Client**
```bash
./client 89034 "Hello Minitalk"
```

#### Bonus
**Server**
```bash
./server
PID: 54522
😭
```
**Client**
```bash
